My laptop, an AMD thinkpad.

Configuration uses `configuration.nix`, `home-manager` is used for the user configuration.

The desktop is Hyprland window manager

Styling is done via `pywal` whenever possible to make it dynamic depending on the background image.

Currently these are:

- Window borders & shadows (hyprland)
- Taskbar (waybar)
- Terminal colors (kitty)
- Editor colors (VSCode)
- Launcher (fuzzel)
- Notification center (sway-notification-center)
- Logout/sleep/lock/poweroff screen (wlogout)
- Lock screen (hyprlock)
